                    Although we could not trace back a trait for elephants. We at least know how Hardy Weinberg works. By using Hardy Weinberg, we can find the probability of genetic transfer from one specie to another.
                    The equation is as follows: p+q=100 and on the bottom p^2+2pq+q^2. You must take into consideration that if there are any diseases that inherently pass from one person to another,
                    genetic traits may change based on the results! If a genetic trait is high, it may pass from one specie to another. 
After having a climate similar to that of New Jersey, where deciduous forests are present, an African elephant would have to adapt by having more hair, and losing their thick skin. It rains more than in the Savanna. Their trunks would stay the same since they would need it to grab food from the trees. Based on the climate, elephants would also need to change parts of its muscle into blubber since it is a better insulator than muscle, and can prevent cold or heat from entering in. Elephants originated in Africa, and approximately 50 million years ago, started exploring other continents. Besides the wooly mammoth, all the other elephants lived in warmer climates. This was because no other elephant species were there besides them 10,000 years ago, and adapted by adding fur to their body. Then, when things went back to normal, they lost their fur.
