                    Due to climate change, a subtle mutation change that can occur to help evolve elephants are that their skin will become even wrinklier than it is as time passes. This is since wrinkles on elephants traps moisture which keeps elephants cooler for longer. Since climate change is reducing water, water is becoming scarce and elephants will have to increase their holding capacity of water to prevent them from drying and becoming dehydrated. 
                    The end result of the years after of subtle changes are the skin becoming extremely wrinkled and there will be wrinkles on places that are currently not on elephants as well. In fact, their skin may also become even thicker to help absorb more water such being on a day of rainfall to keep them cool for extended periods of time. 
The current mating ritual for elephants are: The male elephants enter a period of time known as musth once a year. In this time, their testosterone is increased. A fluid leaks from their temporal gland between the eye and ear. The more dominant older males come into musth when a large number of females are in estrus. They begin to do physical behaviors, as flapping their ears, rubbing their head on trees and bushes to spread the musth scent. They also use a low frequency call, which can also attract females that are also ready to mate. Sometimes, females respond, showing interest. If she is interested, she will walk away from her family, as she turned sideways to watch the male who follows behind. Elephants will stroke each other with their trunks before the male mounts the female from behind. Elephant intercourse lasts for up to two minutes. Females may mate with more than one male in each estrus cycle, that can last up to 18 weeks. While elephants may not mate for life, a female may repeatedly choose to mate with the same male. If the environment changes. Their mating may change slightly. For instance, water quality and availability is being drastically affected in Africa. This leads to particular challenges as this also changes the rainfall patterns as well. The male elephants use their musth to rub off on trees and plants to disperse their scent. Although with what was mentioned prior, these plants may not adapt to the rainfall pattern and lack of water and die off, which causes the elephants requiring an alternative object to disperse their scent. If they do not disperse their scent, they are less likely to find a mate which makes reproduction increasingly difficult. A possible solution to this is for male elephants to focus more on mating calls to attract female elephants which they tend to use sometimes. This is their only alternative as plants may not survive in their habitat due to climate change and the elephant will not have anything to disperse their musth on. With prioritizing their vocal calls, elephants will eventually lose their musth as it would not be needed in an area which does not have as many plants or none.
