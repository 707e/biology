<h1>Our Progress Throughout the Months</h1>
<h2>September</h2>
<p>During the month of September, the group had focused on coding the base of the website. 
    We added styles, fonts, and attempted to make everything aesthetically pleasing. 
</p>

<h2>October</h2>
<p>Throughout October, the group had looked into TeleMedicine and researched all about how it
    works. Knowing more about the topic, we created the fictitious company and explained what the website
    will be capable of. 
</p>

<h2>November</h2>
<p>Going through November, the group had decided to choose the main four doctors that would be required
    for a TeleMedicine company. This would allow the customer to choose a specific doctor based on their needs. 
</p>

<h2>December</h2>
<p>During December, the group planned on creating a functional login page that allowed users to create an account
    for the website. Throughout the month, they had mainly researched about the use of firebase and made a simple login
page. </p>

<h2>January</h2>
<p>Throughout January, the group had improved upon the login page, also adding more text and information
    about the website. With this new information, it would allow customers to easily navigate the website.
</p>

<h2>February</h2>
